This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  For example:

```javascript
const user = await getUser();
console.log(user.name); // Error if getUser() returns null or undefined
```

In React Native, this often happens when fetching data from an API or using asynchronous operations.  If the data hasn't loaded yet, or the API request fails, the `user` object might be null, leading to this error.
